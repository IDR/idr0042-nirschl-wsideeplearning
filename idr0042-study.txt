Quality Control Description	"Training and held-out test datasets were randomly allocated prior to image analysis. The training dataset was split into three folds for cross-validation to monitor training progress. The held-out test dataset was tested after all training, fine-tuning, and optimization was performed."

Protocol description	"Human tissue research: Human heart tissue was procured from two separate groups of subjects: heart transplant or LVAD recipients with severe heart failure (Fal), and brain dead, organ donors with no history of heart failure (non-failing, NF). Tissue from patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy sampled infarct-free regions.  No organs or tissue were procured from prisoners. Prospective informed consent for research use of heart tissue was obtained from all transplant or LVAD recipients and next-of-kin in the case of organ donors. All patient data and images were de-identified, and all protocols were performed in accordance with relevant guidelines for research involving tissue from human subjects. Tissue used in this study was collected and processed at the Cardiovascular Research Institute and the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania between 2008 and 2013. All patients were from the same institutional cohort. All study procedures were approved or waived by the University of Pennsylvania Institutional Review Board."	"Dataset collection and histological processing: Both failing and non-failing hearts received in situ cold cardioplegia in the operating room and were immediately placed on wet ice in 4Â°C Krebs-Henseleit buffer. Within 4 hours of cardiectomy, transmural tissue from the left ventricular free wall were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and later processed, embedded in paraffin, sectioned and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for morphologic analysis. Whole-slide images were acquired at 20x magnification using an Aperio ScanScope slide scanner. Images were down-sampled to 5x magnification for image analysis, a magnification sufficient for expert assessment of gross tissue pathology. The allocation to the training and held-out test cohort was random and performed prior to image analysis."
